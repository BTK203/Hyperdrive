# Hyperdrive
An easy-to-implment autonomous driving library for FRC robots, developed by FRC team 3695, Foximus Prime. Hyperdrive was able to produce a cumulative time of
28.3 seconds on the Auto-Nav challenge in the 2021 FRC season, and a 9.9 second cumulative time on the Galactic Search challenge. It is currently being developed to support tank-style robots, but support for swerve robots will hopefully be implemented as well.

The actual library itself is located inside of its testing environment at [HyperdriveProject/Hyperdrive/src/main/java/frc/robot/util/hyperdrive](https://github.com/BTK203/Hyperdrive/tree/develop/HyperdriveProject/Hyperdrive/src/main/java/frc/robot/util/hyperdrive).
