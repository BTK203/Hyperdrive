# Hyperdrive
An easy-to-implment autonomous driving library for FRC robots, developed by FRC team 3695, Foximus Prime. Hyperdrive was able to produce a cumulative time of
28.3 seconds on the Auto-Nav challenge in the 2021 FRC season, and a 9.9 second cumulative time on the Galactic Search challenge.

This library is currently being developed to support tank-style robots, but support for swerve robots will hopefully be implemented as well.
