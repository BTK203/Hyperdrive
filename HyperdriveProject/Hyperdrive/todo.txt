THINGS TO DO (sequentially):

Stuff to implement:
- Manual drive distance setting (for test purposes) ...done 
- Manual position setting (for test purposes) ...done
- Write chord-based displacement for position tracking

Unit tests
- Test position calculation for tank drive (it will work swerve is this passes) ...done
- Test Path Recording ..done
- Test trajectory / right and left velocity calculation for tank drive. ...done

Todos
- Resolve any TODOs in code

Version Control
- Clean the project
- Make GitHub repo

Integration testing
- Test position tracking with both "always linear" mode and "chord" mode.
- Test functionality on (hopefully 2019) robot.
- When/If time allows, test on 2021 robot. On this test, try to implement the code as fast as possible.

Documentation
- Create the Manual

Version Control again
- If tests produced satisfactory results, release the code.
