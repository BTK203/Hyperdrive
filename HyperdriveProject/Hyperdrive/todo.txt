THINGS TO DO:

- Decide how to track the SimulatedRobot's acceleration. Options are:
    - Keep record of motors (CIM, NEO, Falcon) and calculate acceleration based on the power curves of those motors.
    This would be more accurate, but the physics would be difficult. Power curves have clearly defined equations for 
    wattage as a function of RPM, so we could use an energy equation to figure out the force if we could confirm how 
    percent output affects the wattage (currently thinking the wattage is recorded at 100% output, but we should check)

    - Keep record of maximum velocity and acceleration and assume that the percent output affects those linearly. This
    is definitely the easier option, but would not be as accurate.

- Once the SimulatedRobot is solid, do the physics to figure out how to calculate displacement given the percent outputs
of the motors. Then, implement it.
