/** 
 * A class that tracks the position of the robot in field space.
 * Because team 3695 has not had experience with swerve drive as of yet,
 * this class is primarly programmed for tank bots.
 * <br><br>
 * This class relies on the integrity of the drivetrain encoder readouts to calculate
 * the robot's position on the field. Those encoder counts must be as close as
 * possible to the actual displacement of the wheel from its starting position. That
 * being said, in order for this class to accurately report the robot's true position
 * on the field, the drivetrain wheels cannot drift. Drifting will result in a difference 
 * betweenthe encoder position and the drivetrain's actual position, which will cause this 
 * class to inaccurately report the robot's position.
